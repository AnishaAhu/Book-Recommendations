    <h1>Book Recommendations</h1>
      <p>This is simply a collection of books I have come to enjoy. The books I like tend to be in the fantasy genre, or have something to do with magic. Whether or not you like them is up to you, but it's always fun to give a new book a try!</p>

    <h1>Books</h1>
    <h2><em>Six of Crows</em></h2>
    <p><em>Six of Crows</em> is a heist story by Leigh Bardugo following Kaz Brekker, Inej, Jesper, Wylan, Nina, and Matthias. It is set in the same world as Barrudo's other series, <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, and is a duology, the second book being <em>The Crooked Kingdom</em> (which I also highly recommend after this one). All of the characters in this book have unique strengths, and they are always interesting to read about. One thing I particularly enjoyed about this book is that much of the romance didn't feel stifling to read about. The romance was built on their actual relationships, so it felt rewarding to read about.</p>
    <h2><em>Wings of Fire</em></h2>
    <p><em>Wings of Fire</em> by Tui T. Sutherland isn't exactly young adult fiction and is considered middle grade, but personally, I have been reading these books for quite a while and have a bit of an attachment to them. As a series, <em>Wings of Fire</em> is made up of 3 arcs of books each. There are also side stories, such as <em>Wings of Fire: Legends</em> and <em>Wings of Fire: Winglets</em>. It follows dragons as they solve problems throughout the world. In the first arc, they end a war. In the second arc, they defeat an ancient evil. In the third arc, they... also defeat an ancient evil. I honestly really do love these books, and if you love fantasy and are okay with reading books aimed at a bit of a younger audience, I would not hesitate to recommend this series to you.</p>
    <h2><em>Six Crimson Cranes</em></h2>
    <p>Something I simply want to add, I really love this book's cover. It's absolutely beautiful. Anyway, <em>Six Crimson Cranes</em> by Elizabeth Lim follows a headstrong princess named Shiori who, along with her brothers, gets cursed by her stepmother. Her brothers get turned into cranes, and she cannot speak, for if she does, her brothers will die. But is her stepmother really evil, or is there more at stake here? This book was a fun read, and Shiori is quite the interesting character. Throughout the story, Shiori grows and becomes more mature, and, by the end, has a much greater understanding of the world than before. I particularly enjoyed watching her grow in regards to romance, learning that there is more to it than simply two people getting married. <em>Six Crimson Cranes</em> is also a duology, the second book being <em>The Dragon's Primise</em>. I also recommend you read this one.</p>
    <h2><em>Descendant of the Crane</em></h2>
    <p>Once again, I'd like to point out how beautiful this cover is. <em>Descendant of the Crane</em> by Joan He follows Princess Hesina of Yan after her father, the former ruler of the Kingdom of Yan, dies. She believes he has been murdered, but everyone else doesn't seem to think so. As she digs deep into her father's death, she finds out things about both her father and the kongdom's history that she could never imagine. Unfortunately, this book is open ended with no sequel, do the ending will leave you wanting more. However, throughout this book, I have come to admire Hesina's strong, ambitious character. Even after being betrayed by those she trusted the most, even after losing everything, she doesn't give up and plans to rise again. She has the ambition and strength of will fit for the ruler of a kingdom. Overall, an enjoyable read!</p>
